### üß™ Example: LLM-Based Flight Price Prediction

A recent study demonstrated the application of LLMs for flight trajectory prediction by treating flight data as a language modeling problem. This approach allowed the model to learn complex spatiotemporal patterns for accurate predictions. Similarly, LLMs can be employed to analyze flight pricing data and predict fare trends. ([arXiv][2])
